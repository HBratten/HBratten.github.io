          Hi! I'm Hillary. I am a Front-End Web Developer with a background in
          event management. Much like event planning, I enjoy front-end web
          development because I love creating an experience that people can
          interact with and enjoy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Born and raised in Rochester, New York, but currently located in
          Detroit, Michigan. I graduated from Allegheny College with my Bachelor
          of Arts, with a focus on Communication Arts. After working in the
          event world for five years, I decided I wanted a career where I could
          do problem solving and learn something new everyday. That decision led
          me to where I am today as a web developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some things you should know about me: I am obsessed with Wegmans
          grocery stores, I love Taylor Swift, the holiday season is my favorite
          time of year, and I am always smiling!
