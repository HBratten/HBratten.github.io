        Hi! I'm Hillary. I am a Front-End Web Developer with a background in
        event management. Much like event planning, I enjoy front-end web
        development because I love creating an experience that people can
        interact with and enjoy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Born and raised in Rochester, New York, but currently located in
        Detroit, Michigan. I graduated from Allegheny College with my Bachelor
        of Arts, with a focus on Communication Arts. After working in the event
        world for five years, I decided I wanted a career where I could do
        problem solving and learn something new everyday. That decision led me
        to where I am today as a web developer.

        Some things you should know about me: I am obsessed with Wegmans grocery
        stores, I love Taylor Swift, the holiday season is my favorite time of
        year, and I am always smiling!
